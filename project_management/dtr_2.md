Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
Nobody does ALL of one portion. Both of us touch a bit of all the functionality.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
Don't merge your own code, commit pattern: test/functionality = a pushed commit.
Descriptive commit messages/pr notes. 100% test coverage/all passing tests before merging.

* Test coverage expectations might change; we're currently at 76% because of untested legacy code. We will see where we are towards the end of the project and decide if it's worth our time to pursue writing more tests.*

Read through all the code on the PR's.
Leave comments on specific lines.
