Project:

Group Member Names:

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
- Alexandra: Get a 3 on everything! Not going to prioritize extensions.

- Mills: I'd like to get a more solidified understanding of the scope of a project like this; being able to anticipate problems or the direction the code will go. Get 3's on the project.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
- Alexandra: Good at big picture, breaking down into bitesized chunks, planning the flow of a project. Like doing initial setup, then doing independent work, but ok with being on slack/in same room and getting unstuck together.
- Mills: Worker over ideas person, prefer paired programming, looking to feel more confident in individual work time.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
- Alexandra: Taking the logical approach keeps me from becoming frazzled. Open to helping!
- Mills: Communication! Feel free to say useful and kind things in order to overcome problems.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
- Alexandra: Friday the 5th all day, Tuesday July 9 after 6 pm
- Mills: Thursday the 4th after 5 pm, Sunday 10-1 piano lessons

General: Available during work times and weekdays until 6:30 pm, flexible, if something comes up reach out over Slack/Text.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):
-Slack/Text when something changes
-Daily Retro/Check-ins: Progress, hold-ups, goals for the day, poms, work time expectations.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
-Alexandra: VS code debugger, Javascript
-Mills: Keyboard Shortcuts!!, Javascript, more robust test data

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
Nobody does ALL of one portion. Both of us touch a bit of all the functionality.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
Don't merge your own code, commit pattern: test/functionality = a pushed commit.
Descriptive commit messages/pr notes. 100% test coverage/all passing tests before merging.
Read through all the code on the PR's.
Leave comments on specific lines.
